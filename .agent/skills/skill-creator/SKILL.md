# Skill Creator

You are an expert in creating high-quality AI agent skills. Your goal is to generate comprehensive, well-structured skills that follow established patterns and maintain consistency across the skill library.

## What is a Skill?

A skill is a specialized instruction set that extends an AI agent's capabilities for specific tasks. Skills live in `.agent/skills/[skill-name]/` and contain:

- **SKILL.md** (required): Main instruction file with YAML frontmatter + markdown
- **references/** (optional): Supporting documents, examples, checklists
- **scripts/** (optional): Automation scripts and utilities
- **examples/** (optional): Reference implementations

---

## Skill Categories

When creating skills, first identify the category:

| Category | Focus | Examples |
|----------|-------|----------|
| **Marketing** | Growth, conversion, content | copywriting, seo-audit, page-cro |
| **Development** | Code, architecture, infrastructure | web-architecture, auth-implementation |
| **Design** | UI/UX, visual, accessibility | design-system, responsive-design |
| **Operations** | Deployment, monitoring, DevOps | deployment-strategy, monitoring |
| **Integration** | Third-party services, APIs | payment-integration, email-transactional |
| **Strategy** | Planning, decisions, analysis | pricing-strategy, content-strategy |
| **Meta** | Creating/managing other skills | skill-creator |

## Quality Standards

### ✅ A Well-Crafted Skill Has:

| Aspect | Requirement |
|--------|-------------|
| **Clarity** | Anyone can understand what it does and when to use it |
| **Completeness** | Covers the full scope without requiring external knowledge |
| **Actionability** | Provides specific steps, not just general advice |
| **Structure** | Logical flow from understanding → planning → executing |
| **Examples** | Concrete illustrations of abstract concepts |
| **Checklists** | Validation steps to ensure quality |
| **Cross-references** | Links to related skills for complete coverage |

### ❌ Common Skill Anti-Patterns:

- **Too vague**: "Make it good" without defining what good means
- **Too narrow**: Only covers one specific case
- **Too broad**: Tries to cover everything, covers nothing well
- **No structure**: Wall of text without sections
- **No examples**: Abstract principles without concrete application
- **No validation**: No way to verify the work is complete
- **Orphaned**: No connection to other skills

---

## Skill Naming Conventions

### File/Folder Names
- **Format**: `kebab-case` (lowercase with hyphens)
- **Length**: 2-4 words maximum
- **Style**: Descriptive, not clever

| ✅ Good | ❌ Bad |
|---------|--------|
| `seo-audit` | `SEO_Audit` |
| `auth-implementation` | `authentication-and-authorization-implementation` |
| `payment-integration` | `stripe-paddle-payment` |
| `design-system` | `ds` |

### Skill Titles (in markdown)
- **Format**: Title Case
- **Style**: Clear and professional

## Creating a New Skill: Process

### Phase 1: Research & Planning

1. **Identify the gap**
   - What task is not currently covered?
   - Who needs this skill and when?

2. **Define scope**
   - What's included?
   - What's explicitly excluded?
   - What related skills exist?

3. **Research best practices**
   - Industry standards
   - Common patterns
   - Anti-patterns to avoid

### Phase 2: Structure & Draft

1. **Create folder structure**
   ```
   .agent/skills/[skill-name]/
   ├── SKILL.md
   └── references/
       └── [supporting-docs].md
   ```

2. **Write YAML frontmatter**
   - Name, version, description
   - Trigger phrases
   - Related skill references

3. **Draft core sections**
   - Initial Assessment
   - Core Principles
   - Main Framework
   - Implementation Steps

### Phase 3: Enhance & Validate

1. **Add examples**
   - Code snippets for technical skills
   - Copy examples for marketing skills
   - Output templates

2. **Create checklists**
   - Pre-action validation
   - Post-action verification

3. **Cross-reference**
   - Link to related skills
   - Reference external resources

4. **Review against quality standards**
   - Run through the checklist below

## Meta Notes

This skill should be used by the AI agent when:
1. User explicitly requests a new skill
2. A gap is identified in the skill library
3. An existing skill needs to be restructured
4. Skill quality standards need to be applied

**Skill creation is iterative**: Create, test, refine based on real usage.
